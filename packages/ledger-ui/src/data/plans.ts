/**
 * The Plans contract (slice S3; orchestrator file, protected for builders). What the Plans tab reads and writes, in the
 * shapes of the buzz-school routes it will call in S8 (no invented routes):
 *
 * - reads, brief A item 3 (`packages/family-service/src/routes/ledger-admin.ts`):
 *   `GET /school-admin/schools/<id>/billing/menu/versions` and `GET .../billing/menu/versions/<n>`;
 * - counts, `GET /school-admin/schools/<id>/billing/members` (per tier) plus the members list (quantities) and atm's
 *   ledger (collected), joined by the S8 adapter into `PlanSummary`;
 * - writes, the existing menu save and publish (`src/routes/school-billing.ts`):
 *   `POST /school-admin/schools/<id>/billing/menu` with the whole `Menu` as its body (an unpublished draft is edited in
 *   place; editing a published menu starts the next version) and `POST .../billing/menu/publish` with no body.
 *
 * The draft and the live version. The live version is the newest version with `publishedAt` set; the draft is the
 * newest version when its `publishedAt` is null (buzz-school keeps at most one, edited in place). With no unpublished
 * version the draft starts as a copy of the live menu; with no version at all it starts empty, from the school's
 * currency (lower case) and time zone and `PlanSummary.features`. "Changes" are the draft compared with the live menu,
 * item by item (the mockup's `diff`): a draft equal to the live menu has no changes and shows no draft badge.
 *
 * One draft, three views. Edit (table and drawer), Preview (the purchase page) and Code (YAML) show and change the SAME
 * draft: a change made in one is what the other two show next. The UI saves the draft with `saveMenu` whenever it
 * changes and has no problems (Save to draft in the drawer, a Code edit once applied, Discard draft, Reset to
 * published), always with the whole menu; a draft with problems stays on screen, unsaved, until fixed. Publishing calls
 * `publishMenu` and then shows the draft as the new live version (the version number plus one) without re-reading.
 *
 * YAML round trip (Code mode). The text is the mockup's layout (`kEmit`/`kParse`, mockup.html "Plans as YAML") over this
 * `Menu`, and `parse(emit(menu))` equals `menu` for every fixture:
 *
 * ```yaml
 * # <school name>: plans. Edit here, then Review and publish.
 * # Each plan is keyed by its id: rename a plan by changing name, not id.
 * # Lines that start with # stripe: are read-only and come back when you Format.
 * version: 3                 # the live version (0 before the first publish); read-only
 * currency: USD              # Menu.currency upper-cased; read-only (Settings)
 * timeZone: America/Denver   # read-only (Settings)
 *
 * memberships:               # `memberships: []` when there are none
 *   # stripe: product · month price · year price
 *   - id: sparkle
 *     name: Sparkle
 *     blurb: A little time, every month
 *     public: true
 *     audience: governance   # only when the audience is not member
 *     prices:                # left out when the tier has no price
 *       month: 32.5          # major units: amount / 100
 *       year: 350
 *     quantities: [1, 2, 4]  # only when set
 *     grants:
 *       - feature: sessions  # a featureId of the menu
 *         units: 8           # amount
 *         every: month
 *         rollover: 1        # rollover.months, 0 when there is none
 *
 * packs:                     # `packs: []` when there are none
 *   # stripe: product · price
 *   - id: pack8
 *     name: Top-up pack
 *     price: 40
 *     every: once
 *     grants: (as above)
 * ```
 *
 * A scalar is written plain when it matches `/^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9 .,;!?()/&+_-]*$/`, has no trailing space, is not a
 * YAML word (true, false, null, yes, no, on, off, y, n) and is not a number; otherwise as a JSON string. The text ends
 * with a newline. A `# stripe:` line lists what the LIVE version has on Stripe for that item (`MenuVersionBody.stripe`,
 * keys `t:<id>`, `t:<id>:<interval>`, `a:<id>`, `a:<id>:<every>`), never an id: `product`, then `month price`,
 * `year price` (tiers) or `price` (packs), joined by ` · `; an item with no product there reads
 * `# stripe: created when you publish`. Comments are not kept (Format drops them and writes the `# stripe:` lines
 * again); anchors, aliases, tags, merge keys, block text, inline maps, tabs, unknown keys and a second document are
 * refused with the mockup's messages, and a refused text leaves the draft unchanged. Amounts parse back as cents and
 * must be whole cents. `rollover.max` is not offered (the mockup: "A cap on rollover isn't enforced yet") and a Code
 * edit keeps the draft's value. A pack's grants keep their stored `every` (buzz-school grants a `once` pack's grants on
 * its first invoice whatever their interval; the fixtures store `month`).
