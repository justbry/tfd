/**
 * School books: audiences and disclosure (spec v2, `plans/ledger-ui/loop/runs/disclosure-v2/school-books-disclosure-spec-v2.md`).
 * The orchestrator's contract, shared by every slice and protected (protocol §4). One `Disclosure` per school drives
 * what each audience sees: the B4 Uni disclosure file (buzz-school `packages/family-service/src/books/disclosure.v1.json`),
 * the school's stored override, the signed-in person's audiences, and, worked out by the server at the clock, the
 * periods, presets, summaries and lock panels the UI shows. The Reader of `reader.ts` extends `DisclosureReader`.
 *
 * What is being viewed is the hash parameter `as=owner|finance|admin|governance|member|public` (the mockup's View as
 * rows, S2's hash grammar). `admin` is a role, not an audience: an admin without the finance grant, whose books follow
 * their own membership (`ViewAsOption.audience`). Absent, or naming a row the signed-in person may not preview
 * (mockup `vaAllowed`), it is their own (`viewer.viewAs`): see `resolveViewAs`. Components read it
 * from the route; the top bar's View as dropdown only writes it. A gated surface renders the viewed option's
 * `LockPanel`, never an empty table or a 0.
 *
 * The functions below are the spec's rules as the settings table and its override editor need them (the effective
 * file, a class's rule with inheritance, the validator's checks): the same rules the server applies, so the editor
 * shows what the server will answer. They derive no figure.
