/**
 * The real `atm` command line with one change: the folder store kills the process (SIGKILL, no cleanup) at a chosen
 * operation. It exists for the crash drill (`tests/golden-e2e-check.test.ts`, S4), which needs to stop `atm ship` and
 * `atm inputs ship` at an exact point instead of at a lucky moment.
 *
 *   TFD_KILL_OP     put or delete: which store operation to count (default put)
 *   TFD_KILL_AT     the 1-based count of that operation at which to die (0 or unset: never)
 *   TFD_KILL_PHASE  before: die as the operation begins; after: die as it has finished and before the shipper marks its rows
 *
 * Each is also read by its old name (`ATM_KILL_*`) when the `TFD_KILL_*` one is not set.
 *
 * Usage: bun scripts/golden-e2e-kill.ts <atm arguments>, for example `inputs ship --db ... --school ... --env live --root ...`.
