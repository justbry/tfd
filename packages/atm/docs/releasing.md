# Releasing the Trifold engine

How a release of `packages/atm` is made and checked. Written from the header of `release.ts`, the recipes in `justfile`, the workflow `.github/workflows/release-atm.yml` and what the release records in `CHANGELOG.md` say. The records of each release (tag, commit, tarball URL, sha256 and sha512) are in `CHANGELOG.md`; what a caller must change per release is in `UPGRADING.md`. Related: `docs/README.md`, `docs/financial-reports.md`.

The package, the tag and the tarball are named `tfd` since 0.11.0 (`tfd-v<version>`, `tfd-<version>.tgz`); releases through 0.10.0 are `atm-v<version>` and stay where they are. The releases are still published to `justbry/atm` (`REPO` in `release.ts`), though the working repository is `justbry/tfd`. buzz-school keeps the dependency key `atm` (`docs/frozen-identifiers.md`).

## What a release is

A tarball on a GitHub release, `tfd-<version>.tgz`, which B4 Uni's family service pins by URL (`https://github.com/justbry/atm/releases/download/tfd-v<version>/tfd-<version>.tgz`) with the tarball's sha512 in its `bun.lock`. The tag is `tfd-v<version>`; the version is read from `packages/atm/package.json`. The same commit always gives the same tarball bytes (fixed file times, no random content).

## The bun version

The bundler and the packer are part of the bytes, so a release is only reproducible on the bun the repo pins (`packageManager` in the root `package.json`, now `bun@1.4.4`). `release.ts` refuses to run on another bun version. The tag-push workflow installs bun 1.4.4. The release records in `CHANGELOG.md` name the bun each tarball was built with (0.3.0 was built with bun 1.4.2; 0.4.0 and 0.5.0 with bun 1.4.4; the changelog's table lists #19 and #20 as "bun 1.4.4 pinned on the release path").

## Steps

1. Bump `version` in `packages/atm/package.json` and merge it with the upgrade notes (`UPGRADING.md`, "Moving to <version> from <previous>").
2. Dry run, which creates nothing: `just release-dry` from `packages/atm` (it runs `bun ./release.ts --dry-run`; from the repo root, `bun run --cwd packages/atm release --dry-run`). It builds into a temp directory, runs the dist checks and `tests/dist.test.ts` against that output, stages the publish package (no dependencies, no bin, no scripts: the engine is inlined; the files are `LICENSE`, `README.md`, `dist/index.d.ts`, `dist/index.js`, `dist/types.d.ts`, `dist/worker.d.ts`, `dist/worker.js` and `package.json`; `LICENSE.md`, `LICENSING.md` and `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt` take the place of `LICENSE`), packs it, and prints the tarball's sha256 and the sha512 integrity that `bun.lock` will record. A check a real run would refuse on is printed, not fatal.
3. A real release: `just release` (asks to confirm) or `bun run --cwd packages/atm release`. It refuses unless the working tree is clean, HEAD is on a branch of `origin`, and neither the tag `tfd-v<version>` nor a GitHub release for it exists. Then it does what the dry run does and creates the release at HEAD.
4. The tag-push workflow `Release atm` (`.github/workflows/release-atm.yml`) runs when a tag `tfd-v*` is pushed: it checks out the tag, sets up bun 1.4.4, installs with the frozen lockfile and runs `release --ci`. In `--ci` mode HEAD must be the commit the tag points at, and an existing release is accepted when its asset is byte-for-byte what this build makes (it fails if not).
5. Verify the published tarball: download the release asset and compare its sha256 and sha512 with what the release script printed. The records of 0.4.0 and 0.5.0 say "checked by downloading the published asset".
6. Record the release in `CHANGELOG.md`: tag, commit, date, tarball URL, sha256 and sha512, the bun version, and what the release holds (the PR table with merge commits).
7. Pin it in `buzz-school`: the family service's `bun.lock` records the tarball's sha512 (see the open `buzz-school` lines in `ROADMAP.md`).

## Recipes

From `packages/atm`: `just release-dry` (build, check and pack; prints the sha256 and sha512; creates nothing) and `just release` (creates the GitHub release `tfd-v<version>` at HEAD with the tarball; needs a clean, pushed HEAD and the pinned bun). `just check` is the whole local gate before a commit: lint, typecheck, tests, build, knip.
