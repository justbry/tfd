/**
 * The second golden fixture (`fixtures/vibes-multi`): twelve families of one school from November 2026 to February 2027, with
 * a year boundary, school-day boundary payments, disputes won and lost, a fundraise, a cancel, an erasure, credit alerts and a
 * late event. `expected.json` is the generator's own ledger (see `fixtures/vibes-multi.ts`: money from its own arithmetic,
 * credits from the engine's events, never from `buildJournal`), so these tests are not circular.
 *
 * Each family of assertion is a function that returns its problems, and the suite runs it on the real books (no problem) and on
 * books with one thing broken (a problem): a check that cannot fail proves nothing. The CSV under `golden/multi` is rewritten
 * with `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1`, as the other goldens are. A last test builds 400 families by 12 months through the real handler.
