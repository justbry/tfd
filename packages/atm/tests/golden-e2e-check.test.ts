/**
 * The golden end-to-end check (`docs/golden-e2e-check.md`): the golden fixtures put through the whole pipeline with the real
 * `atm` command line as separate processes, on file-backed WAL SQLite and a folder, never through library calls.
 *
 *   S1  every bundle (the 39 matrix cases and the rest) through the reference handler into one database file per school, then
 *       `atm inputs ship`, `atm ship`, `atm journal`, `atm report`, `atm reconcile` and `atm simulate --inputs` (database and
 *       folder, no candidate and with candidates), against the committed goldens
 *   S2  the golden year and the multi-school fixture: ship, journal, report, reconcile, byte for byte against golden/{journal,reports,multi}
 *   S3  an erasure drill with a search of every file and table for the erased family's strings and ids
 *   S4  SIGKILL of `atm inputs ship`, `atm ship` and the erasure settle, then a rerun, against an uninterrupted run
 *   S5  hashes of the database and the folder around every read-only command (inside S1 to S4)
 *   S6  the same under TZ=America/Denver and TZ=Asia/Tokyo
 *
 * The default run is a sample that takes about two minutes. `TFD_GOLDEN_E2E=full` runs every bundle, all kill points and both
 * time zones over everything. `TFD_GOLDEN_E2E_SHARD=1/6` runs one sixth of either run (of its bundles, then of the tests after
 * them), to run six processes at once. S7, the scale probe, is `scripts/golden-e2e-scale.ts`. A finding is something the
 * design says should not happen: the ones known today are listed below and pinned, so a test fails when one appears or goes
 * away.
