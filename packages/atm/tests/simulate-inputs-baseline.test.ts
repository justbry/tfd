/**
 * The baseline identity of `simulateFromInputs`: every input the real handler stored, decided again with the menu and policy
 * it was decided under, must give the events the handler put in the outbox, by `idem` and canonical body. This is the first
 * test of the replay; a what-if is only as good as it. Histories: the 8 recorded sandbox scenarios delivered through the
 * handler, and 300 seeded histories of `billing-play.ts` over the handler (some in order, some with deliveries held back and
 * retried after a 409, sent twice, failing once and retried, refused under a broken menu and applied later), with the
 * family service's spends and credit holds. Design: `docs/simulate-from-inputs.md`, sections 4 and 10.
