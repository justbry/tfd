/**
 * The Worker entry (`atm/worker`): the read side of the ledger for a reader with no disk and no database, an admin UI
 * in a Cloudflare Worker over R2. Everything goes through a `Store`; `R2BindingStore` is one over a Worker's R2 binding. `kpiDocument` builds a school's KPI
 * document for an audience from its KPI rows, and `suppressKpis` is the cell-rule suppression of the KPI export; both are
 * pure and Ajv-free. `isLedgerTokenAudience` is the `aud` check of a ledger token (`tfd-ledger`, and `atm-ledger` for the
 * rename window). Needs the `nodejs_compat` flag (see README).
