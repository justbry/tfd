/**
 * One entry point for a Stripe event. The family service verifies the signature, dedupes on the event id, calls
 * `handleStripeEvent` with the subject's stored rows and writes the result in one transaction; everything between is
 * here and pure:
 *
 *   raw event -> mappingFor + normalize -> a fact -> the grant rules -> engine commands -> the engine
 *     -> row changes (engine rows and the grants row, one revision) and decision events (credit.*)
 *
 * Nothing is written and no clock is read. Replaying an event gives no changes and no events. An event atm cannot
 * decide (unknown shape, a line not on the menu, an engine rejection) comes back `refused`: no rows and no credit
 * events are to be written, keep the event and retry once the cause is fixed. The one thing to write is the money of a
 * paid invoice whose credits were refused: `refused.payment` (see `withCertainPayment`).
