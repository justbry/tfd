/**
 * The commands of a bookable item that run on a subject's stored rows: hold credits on an engine lock, then spend them or give
 * them back. Each takes the rows and revision as stored (as `handleStripeEvent` does) and returns one write for the subject
 * (the engine's rows and the grants row under one revision) with the ledger events, or a typed refusal. Pure: no clock, no
 * randomness; every id is made from the booking id.
 *
 * Engine mapping: hold is `track` with a lock, settle is `finalize` (`finalValue` null spends what the lock took, 0 gives it
 * back) and an expired hold that confirms is `confirmExpiredLock`. `commandOrg(policy)` is on every command that draws, so
 * the row that lapses soonest is drawn first and a release returns the credits to the rows they came from.
 *
 * The engine's stored rows keep only an open lock's ids, and `finalize` needs the whole lock row, so the row is kept in
 * `GrantsState.bookings[id].lock` until the booking is settled.
 *
 * A hold whose `expiresAt` has passed (the lock's own expiry action is not run by the engine; a caller's sweep applies it
 * with `settleExpiredHold`): a call that would do what the expiry action does (spend on a `confirm` hold, give back on a
 * `release` hold) still works, with the caller's own `settledBy`; a call that would do the opposite is `hold_expired`.
 *
 * What a release gives back (every way a booking is released: release, cancel, a late cancel or a no-show that releases,
 * an expired hold that releases). The units of each row the lock drew from go back to that row, except:
 * - units an invoice refunded or lost in a dispute while they were held is owed (`InvoiceRecord.owed`): taken back, booked
 *   `credit.adjusted`; a spend of them clears what is owed instead (they were used);
 * - units of a row that has lapsed (`expires_at` at or before the call), or that is gone: they lapsed while held, booked
 *   `credit.expired`; the row is not refilled, so the cron's lapse of it and the books agree in any order;
 * - units of a tier or add-on row that has reset since the hold (`BookingRecord.resetsAt`): last cycle's units, so they do
 *   not go to the new cycle. They come back as a rollover lapsing when last cycle's leftovers do, as far as the row's
 *   rollover rule (its catalog entitlement: months and cap, less the rollovers the row already holds) allows; the rest
 *   lapse (`credit.expired`). A row with no rollover lapses them all.
 * Units that do not come back are left off the lock the `finalize` settles, so the engine never puts them back; the events
 * book them as released, then expired or adjusted (`payload.withheld`).
