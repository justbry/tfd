/**
 * Read models for the admin UI, built from the event log and written next to it, all under `schools/<school>/views/`:
 * `months/YYYY-MM.json`, `members/<hash>.json`, `members/index.json`, `finance/months/YYYY-MM.json`,
 * `finance/members/<hash>.json`, `kpi/contributions/YYYY-MM.json` and `manifest.json`. The month view holds no money:
 * the books are under `finance/` (finance.ts), so a reader that may not see them never opens that prefix; the
 * contributions (contributions.ts) are counts and a share per KPI cell, never a key. `buildViews` is pure;
 * `writeViews` puts the objects through a `Store` and `readViewsFromStore` reads them back, verified. All three are the
 * Worker-safe side of atm (no `node:fs`, no `ajv`).
 *
 * A member's object name is a hash of the school and the holder key, never the key: an object listing (or a log line of
 * a path) does not carry a family id. The body holds the key, and `members/index.json` lists every member's object name
 * with its key and `lastEventAt`, so a reader opens one object for the list instead of listing the prefix and opening
 * every body. The bodies hold no names or emails. A finance member object is named by the same hash.
 *
 * Every object is content only: they hold nothing about the run (no `asOf`), so the same events
 * give the same bytes and a scheduled run rewrites only what changed. What the run was is in `manifest.json`: its `asOf`,
 * the events it read, and `objects`, the SHA-256 of the bytes of every object the run meant to leave (by object key).
 *
 * What the manifest does and does not promise. Object keys are stable: a run overwrites the same key in place (no
 * content-addressed keys, so there is nothing to collect). The manifest is written last, but that does not make it a
 * snapshot: while a run is in flight, or after one failed partway, objects are NEWER than the manifest; and when an older
 * run's writes land after a newer run's manifest (the stale check below cannot see a writer already past it), they are
 * OLDER than it. The manifest names what the objects should hold; it does not say they hold it. A reader checks:
 * `readViewsFromStore` hashes the bytes of each object it returns and answers `view-mismatch` for one that differs from
 * the manifest. A mismatch means a run is in flight or died; the reader retries or falls back, and the next complete run
 * (any `asOf` not older than the manifest's) rewrites the objects and so clears it.
