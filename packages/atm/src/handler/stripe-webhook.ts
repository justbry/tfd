/**
 * Reference webhook handler for the family service: one Stripe webhook in, rows and decision events out, on a
 * synchronous SQLite the caller owns. For Bun and Node.
 *
 *   verify signature -> claim the Stripe event id (stale-claim takeover) -> in ONE transaction:
 *     load the subject's rows -> handleStripeEvent -> write rows (revision-checked) -> events into the outbox
 *     -> invoice index (and the caller's payment refs) -> claim done
 *
 *   invoice_payment.paid: the same verify and claim, then in ONE transaction: normalise -> the invoice must be in the
 *     invoice index -> payment index (payment intent and charge -> invoice) -> claim done. It decides nothing and moves
 *     no credits; it only records which payment paid which invoice.
 *
 * Decisions
 *
 * - One endpoint, one school. `deps.secret` proves only which Stripe account sent the event; the `b4u_school` in its
 *   metadata is that account's claim, and `deps.context` answers for every school the service serves. So the handler
 *   takes the school the endpoint and its secret belong to (`deps.schoolId`) and refuses, with 422 `school_mismatch`
 *   before any claim (or releasing it, for `invoice_payment.paid`) and writing nothing, any event whose school is
 *   another: from the metadata of an `invoice.paid` or `customer.subscription.*`, or from the subject the invoice
 *   index names for a refund, a dispute or an `invoice_payment.paid`. Serve each school from its own endpoint.
 * - The handler sets no limit on the body's size. The caller must cap the raw body (say 1 MiB; Stripe's events are
 *   far smaller) before it is read into memory and HMACed here.
 * - The claim is its own short transaction, so a second delivery sees it at once. Its `done` state is written only in
 *   the transaction that wrote the rows. A crash before commit leaves rows and outbox as they were and the claim
 *   `claimed`; a later delivery takes it over once it is older than `claimStaleAfterMs`, with a compare-and-set
 *   UPDATE on the stale `claimed_at` (one taker wins, the other answers busy). The transaction starts by checking the
 *   claim is still this worker's, and ends by marking it done with the same check, so a worker that stalled past the
 *   window cannot commit over the one that took over.
 * - A thrown error (the context, the database, a bug) is not caught: it propagates and the claim stays `claimed`,
 *   exactly as for a crash. The caller answers 500 and Stripe retries.
 * - Live balances stay in the caller's SQLite (`atm_rows`). Decision events go to `ledger_outbox` in the same
 *   transaction; `body` is the event's canonical line, fixed at insert, and the insert is ON CONFLICT
 *   (school_id, idem) DO NOTHING. The table's primary key (school_id, id) is not that target, and SQLite aborts on
 *   it; that is deliberate. An event's id is `deterministicUlid` of its instant, its revision and a 56-bit hash of
 *   (school, idem), so the same id under another idem takes a hash collision at the same millisecond and revision.
 *   Were it to happen, a throw (500, retry) is right; `INSERT OR IGNORE` would silently drop a distinct decision.
 * - The revision is read and checked inside the write transaction (`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` in `bunSqlite`), so a conflict
 *   cannot happen on one SQLite file; the check and the 3 attempts are for drivers whose transactions are not
 *   exclusive. After 3 stale attempts the claim is released and the answer is 409.
 * - Env is in every key. `atm_event_claims`, `atm_invoice_index` and `atm_payment_index` are keyed `(env, id)` and
 *   `ledger_outbox` `(school_id, env, id)`, `env` being `deps.env`, so one Stripe id delivered under both envs is claimed,
 *   indexed and booked once in each, and a refund's payment-to-invoice join stays inside its env. A database made before
 *   env was a key needs `migrateHandlerSchema(db)` once; without it the handler throws before touching anything.
 * - Stored inputs. In the same transaction as the rows, the outbox rows and the claim's done mark, the delivery is also
 *   written to `atm_event_inputs` by `recordInput` (src/handler/inputs.ts): the trimmed fact the rules decided on, the fee and
 *   payment refs, the SHA-256 of the raw body (never the body), and the menu and policy in force. What is stored: an applied
 *   delivery (an `invoice_payment.paid` too) and a 422 refusal (replaced when the event is applied later). Not stored: a
 *   409 wait, another product's event, a type we do not map, a refusal before the claim, an event that does not normalize.
 *   A storage error throws with the rest: nothing is committed, the claim stays `claimed`, Stripe retries.
 * - The Stripe event id is deduplicated here; `handleStripeEvent` gets a ULID derived from the school and that id
 *   and the event's `created`, so the same delivery always decides the same way.
 * - A refund or dispute names its charge and payment intent, never the invoice, and the webhook's invoice names no
 *   payment (API 2025-10-29.clover). The link comes from `invoice_payment.paid`, whose object has the `invoice` and the
 *   payment (`{ type: 'payment_intent', payment_intent }`, or `{ type: 'charge', charge }`). Two indexes, both written
 *   in the transaction of the event that teaches them:
 *     atm_invoice_index  invoice id -> subject   when an `invoice.paid` is applied (it carries the family's metadata)
 *     atm_payment_index  payment intent / charge id -> invoice id   when an `invoice_payment.paid` is handled
 *   A refund or dispute joins the two: payment ref -> invoice -> subject, and passes `invoiceIds` to
 *   `handleStripeEvent`, which checks the invoice is one this holder was paid. When its payment intent and its charge
 *   lead to different subjects, nothing says which is right: 422 `ambiguous_payment`, before any claim.
 * - `invoice_payment.paid` and `invoice.paid` can arrive in either order (Stripe does not promise one). The two orders
 *   and the refund's, where each waits for what it needs (a wait is a 409 and no claim, so Stripe retries):
 *
 *     arrives                      invoice indexed?  payment indexed?  answer
 *     invoice.paid                 -                 -                 200 applied; the invoice is indexed
 *     invoice_payment.paid         yes               -                 200 applied; the payment is indexed
 *     invoice_payment.paid         no                -                 409 `unmatched_invoice`; retry after invoice.paid
 *     refund / dispute             -                 yes               decided as `handleStripeEvent` says
 *     refund / dispute             -                 no                409 `unmatched_payment`; retry after the link
 *
 * - Another product on the same Stripe account. An `invoice.paid` or `customer.subscription.*` with neither
 *   `b4u_school` nor `family_id` in its metadata is not a family's: 200 `ignored`, recorded done (its metadata cannot
 *   change, so a retry could never decide otherwise). Half of them (one key, or an empty value) is a broken checkout:
 *   422 `missing_metadata`. But an `invoice_payment.paid`, refund or dispute names no family, and the invoice it
 *   leads to is never indexed when its `invoice.paid` was ignored, so it keeps the retryable 409 (`unmatched_invoice`,
 *   `unmatched_payment`): it cannot tell "not ours" from "ours, not linked yet", and a 200 there would lose a real
 *   family's refund that came early. Stripe retries a non-2xx in live mode with backoff for up to three days, emails
 *   the account about a failing endpoint and may disable it. So the deployer should give this endpoint only the
 *   event types above (Stripe's "enabled events"), and a Stripe account whose other products have many payments,
 *   refunds or disputes should keep the families on their own account.
 * - `deps.paymentRefs` is optional now: refs it names for an `invoice.paid` are written to `atm_payment_index` with the
 *   invoice's rows, so callers that already know the payment (an expanded invoice, their own records) keep working.
 *   Only its non-empty strings are used. `invoice.payments` is read too when the event came expanded.
 *
 * - The books. An `invoice.paid` also writes a `payment.succeeded` (gross, the fee, the net), a `charge.refunded` a
 *   `payment.refunded` (what that event refunded), and a `payout.paid` a `payout.paid`, all to the outbox beside the
 *   credit events. No webhook event carries Stripe's fee (it is the `fee` of the charge's balance transaction), so the
 *   optional `deps.paymentFee` supplies it, read from Stripe by the caller before the call; without it the payment books
 *   no fee line and the answer says so (`body.feeUnknown`, and a `deps.warn` line). The fee is fixed at the first delivery of the invoice: it is not booked later (a re-send that knows the fee is told so, not booked). A payout names no family
 *   and no school, so it is booked to `deps.schoolId` whatever its `account` says: serve each school from its own
 *   endpoint, on the school's own Stripe account (a Connect endpoint would send every connected account's payouts here).
 *   A `payout.failed` books the payout back: a `payout.paid` event with its sides swapped (`assets:stripe` up,
 *   `assets:clearing:stripe-payouts` down, payload `failed: true`, idem `stripe:<payout id>:failed`, dated by the failure).
 *   It waits (409 `unmatched_payment`, no claim) until the payout's own `payout.paid` is booked, so a payout that failed
 *   before its `payout.paid` arrived is reversed by the retry, and one that never was paid is never booked at all.
 *
 * Answers (Stripe retries every non-2xx for up to three days)
 *
 *   200 applied            rows, outbox and claim done committed (also when the event changes nothing); `body.feeUnknown`
 *                          lists a payment the books hold without its Stripe fee, and `deps.warn` says so
 *   200 non_usd            as `applied`, but an invoice, refund, payout or dispute not in USD left no money line: each left a
 *                          `money.skipped` event, `body.skipped` names them, and `deps.warn` (default stderr) says so
 *   200 duplicate          the Stripe event id is already done; nothing else is touched
 *   200 ignored            an event type we do not map, with no claim recorded (a later version that maps it takes the
 *                          owner's re-send); or an invoice / subscription event with no family metadata, recorded done
 *   400 bad_request        the body is not a Stripe event
 *   401 bad_signature      nothing is touched
 *   409 busy               another worker holds a fresh claim (or took it over); Stripe will retry
 *   409 unmatched_payment  a refund or dispute whose payment is not linked to an invoice yet (its
 *                          invoice_payment.paid, or the invoice itself, may not be handled yet); or a `payout.failed`
 *                          whose `payout.paid` is not booked yet
 *   409 unmatched_invoice  an invoice_payment.paid whose invoice is not indexed (its invoice.paid is not handled yet)
 *   409 stale_revision     3 attempts lost the revision race
 *   409 refused            `unmatched_invoice`, `unknown_subscription`: the cause may arrive on its own, retry
 *   422 refused            `unmatched_line`, `missing_metadata`, `addon_only_subscription`,
 *                          `tier_on_other_subscription`, `unknown_mapping`, `bad_event`, `rejected`; and 422 `unknown_school` when `context` returns null: a human has to fix something
 *   422 school_mismatch    the event's school is not `deps.schoolId`
 *   422 livemode_mismatch  the event's `livemode` disagrees with `deps.env` (a test-mode event to a live handler, or a
 *                          live one to `env: "test"`); refused before any claim, nothing written. An event with no
 *                          boolean `livemode` is not refused
 *   422 ambiguous_payment  a refund or dispute whose payment intent and charge lead to different subjects
 *
 * A refused event never keeps its claim, and no row or credit event is written for it. What decides a refusal (the
 * menu, the code's mappings, the school's configuration) changes by a human's hand, and the owner then re-sends the
 * same Stripe event from the dashboard; a `done` claim would answer that with `duplicate` and the credits would never
 * be granted. The price is that Stripe keeps retrying a 422 until it gives up, which is the nudge we want. Only
 * `applied` and a family-less `ignored` are `done`.
 *
 * One exception, to the money and only to it: a paid invoice refused for `unmatched_line`, `tier_on_other_subscription`,
 * `addon_only_subscription` or `rejected` has its payment (`refused.payment`: the `payment.succeeded`, or the
 * `money.skipped` marker of a non-USD one) appended to the outbox in the transaction that releases the claim. Stripe has
 * the money whatever the menu says; the idem is `stripe:<invoice id>`, so the delivery that is applied once the cause is
 * fixed makes the same event and the outbox keeps the one it has. The invoice is not indexed, so its `invoice_payment.paid`,
 * refund and dispute wait (409) for the applied delivery. Every other refusal books nothing. Reasons and why:
 * `docs/financial-reports.md`, "A paid invoice the handler refuses".
 *
 * Not here, on purpose: no R2 writes, no shipper from the outbox to R2 batches, no compare-and-swap per subject on
 * R2, no Worker version (the ledger's schema validation uses ajv, which compiles with `new Function`, and Workers
 * refuse that).
 *
 * For the owner to review: the 422 versus 409 split above; releasing the claim on every refusal; 409 for a refund of
 * an unknown payment (a charge that is not ours retries until Stripe gives up), and the same for an
 * `invoice_payment.paid` of an unknown invoice (see "Another product" above); one attempt
 * budget (3) for stale revisions; `now` for the engine is the event's `created`, in whole seconds.
