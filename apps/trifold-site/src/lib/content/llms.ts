	"Next, not shipped: the hosted service (early access; design partners are free during the pilot); Rifo, an AI assistant that drafts and explains while you approve and the engine does the math; daily matching to Stripe payouts; a per-event hash chain; and Trifold as an independent witness that countersigns receipts and seals.",
