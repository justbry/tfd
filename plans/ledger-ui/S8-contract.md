# S8 contract: real adapters for the ledger UI (atm, buzz-school, the Worker, the UI)

Status: draft, 2026-11-06. This is the interface between the repos and between the agents that build S8. A child agent codes against this file; a change to it goes through the S8 thread, never between children.

The UI side of the interface is [`S8-ui-needs.md`](S8-ui-needs.md): every call of `packages/ledger-ui/src/data/`, its source and its status. This file does not restate it. It adds the transport rules, the R2 layout, the emission design, the work split, and the corrections found by checking both repos on 2026-11-06 (atm `origin/dev`, buzz-school `origin/main`).

## 1. Ownership and rules for every child

- `packages/ledger-ui/src/data/` and `src/fixtures/` belong to the ledger-ui loop's orchestrator. **No S8 child edits them.** A child that needs a shape changed says so in its report; the S8 thread tells the orchestrator, who changes the contract and the fixtures together so the golden and consistency gates stay green.
- atm children: branch `claude/s8-<slice>`, PR against `dev`, never `main`. buzz-school children: branch `claude/<slug>`, PR against the repo's default integration branch (`gh repo view --json defaultBranchRef`), never `main` and never merged by the child. Local gates only; do not wait on GitHub Actions. Biome only on touched files.
- buzz-school work is done by buzz-school children, not from the atm session. New files where possible, routes registered with the smallest diff, migration numbers checked against what is free at the time.
- Final line of every child report: `PR <full URL>, head <SHA>, local gates <pass/fail list>`, then a short "Gaps found" list (not done, assumptions, anything that contradicts this file).
- The log carries `key = family:<familyId>` and a Stripe customer id, and no name, email or profile id. No S8 code may put one in an event, a view object or a log line. `sub` (profile id) is never written to R2.

## 2. Transport and gating

| Path | Carries | Auth |
| --- | --- | --- |
| browser → `api.b4uni.com` | every write, and every buzz-school read | `b4u_session` cookie (host-only, `SameSite=Lax`; same-site with `ledger.b4uni.com`), CSRF, `Idempotency-Key` on writes. Only paths in `LEDGER_ROUTES` get CORS for the ledger origin. |
| browser → ledger Worker | every read of atm data | `Authorization: Bearer <ledger token>` (5 minutes) |

The browser gets the token from `POST /school-admin/ledger-token` and refreshes it before `exp`. A `503 school_api_unavailable` means "try again", never "no schools".

The Worker, on every request:

1. Verifies the token against `/.well-known/ledger-jwks.json` (cached for its `max-age`, `kid` looked up there, never a key the token carries): `alg` is `EdDSA`, `iss` is this environment's `API_BASE`, `aud` is exactly the string `atm-ledger`, `iat` present and not in the future, `exp - iat <= 300`, `nbf` and `exp` valid. `src/ledger/jwt.ts` `verifyJwt` and `test/ledger-jwt.test.ts` in buzz-school are the reference and the case list.
2. Refuses a school that is not in `schools[]` (same 404 as an unknown school).
3. Serves **raw books data** (ledger rows, income statement lines, members' money, donor rows, payment history) only when the school's entry has `finance: true`. These objects live under `schools/<id>/views/finance/`.
4. Serves a **KPI document** for any listed school, computed on the server from aggregates at an audience no finer than the caller may view (section 4). The Worker reads finance aggregates to build a coarser document; what it returns, never what it reads, is what the audience gate limits. A `finance:false` caller therefore cannot get a row or an exact figure, only the document of their level.
5. Returns the manifest `asOf` on every read, so the UI can show the ship lag and the pending state.

## 3. R2 layout

Under `schools/<id>/`, per environment bucket (decision D2):

```
events/date=YYYY-MM-DD/{batch-*.jsonl, day.jsonl, late-*.jsonl}   existing, written by the shipper
views/manifest.json                                                existing
views/months/YYYY-MM.json                                          existing (S8a removes `money` from it; it moves to finance)
views/members/<hash>.json, views/members/index.json              existing
views/finance/months/YYYY-MM.json                                  new (S8a): money, income by account and plan, fees, refunds, disputes, payouts, fundraising by campaign
views/finance/members/<hash>.json                                  new (S8a): a member's payments, refunds, last payment (no names)
views/kpi/contributions/YYYY-MM.json                               new (S8a): per KPI cell, distinct holders and the largest holder's share (what the cell rules need)
```

Every object is in `manifest.objects` with its sha256, so `readViewsFromStore` verifies it. A change to an existing object's bytes changes the fixtures' golden hashes: S8a tells the S8 thread before it lands so the orchestrator regenerates them in the same PR.

## 4. Audiences and the disclosure

The audiences are public, member, governance, finance, owner (`S8-ui-needs.md`, disclosure; buzz-school spec `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-05-school-books-disclosure-design.md`, status `draft`, nothing built).

- **Token to audience.** `role: owner` is owner; `finance: true` is finance. An admin without the grant reads like anyone else (spec: highest of owner, finance, the tier's `books` level, public). The token carries no membership level, so by default (D7) an admin with `finance:false` gets **public**, and "View as" can only go down. The orchestrator confirms whether the UI expects governance for that admin.
- **The disclosure read.** `disclosure(school)` is a buzz-school read (`books` setting plus the B4 Uni defaults file). It does not exist. Until S8d-bz adds it, the Worker applies the B4 Uni defaults file shipped with the UI/oracle (`src/fixtures/disclosure.json` semantic) and the adapter reports the school as "defaults". The Worker, not the UI, applies it.
- **The document.** `kpiDocument(rows, contributions, disclosure, audience, pin)` is a pure function in `atm/worker` (S8b), moved from `packages/ledger-ui/gates/oracle.ts`. The oracle stays in `gates/` as the independent implementation; the consistency gate compares the two on the same inputs. S8b also carries what the oracle now emits: `tables.month.changes`, `order.revenue_by_tier`, the `dispute_cost` KPI, and `KpiTable.changes`/`order`.

## 5. Event emission (S8d, buzz-school)

Today buzz-school writes no atm event: it imports only `runEngineCommand` (`school-billing/grant.ts`, `adjust.ts`), keeps the revision and the credit lots (`apply.ts`) and drops the engine's event. Its school webhook (`routes/school-billing.ts`, `school-billing/webhook.ts`) writes memberships, lots, claims and audit rows only. It already ships other data to R2 on timers (`journal/ship.ts` with `S3Store` on `aws4fetch`, `records/shipper.ts`, started in `server.ts`), which is the pattern to follow.

What atm offers: `SqlDatabase` (minimal, synchronous, `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions), `HANDLER_DDL` and `migrateHandlerSchema`, `recordEngineCommand`, `recordLapse`, `appendToOutbox(db, events, env)`, `handleStripeWebhook(deps, request)` (the full handler with claims and outbox), the pure `handleStripeEvent`, `planOutbox`/`shipOutbox` (exported from `"."` only), and `R2Store` (S3). No builder for `catalog.published` exists.

**S8d starts with a design spike, in writing, before any code:** does atm's handler keep its own engine state (customer and balance rows) in the SQLite it is given? If it does, running it beside buzz-school's `school_credit_lots` makes two sources of truth. The spike chooses one of: (a) run atm's handler as a ledger-only shadow in its own tables, reading the same verified Stripe event; (b) feed `appendToOutbox` events built by buzz-school's own handler from the lots it already writes; (c) port the posting rules. It names the dual-write risk and how a drift is detected. Default if the spike finds nothing worse: (a), because the postings, refund matching and fee handling are already tested in atm.

Whatever the choice, S8d delivers:

- payment, refund, dispute and fee events for each school, under that school's id and the right env (`live`/`test` from `billingKeyMode`);
- credit events for every engine command buzz-school runs (grant, adjust, forfeit, expire), recorded in the same transaction as the lots they change;
- a `catalog.published` event on menu publish (atm adds the builder, S8a; payload needs `plans`, `menu`, `version`);
- a shipper job per environment writing `schools/<id>/events/` to that environment's bucket (D2), and the views job (section 6, S8c) reading it;
- no Zeffy/donation events (buzz-school stores none; D5).

`shipOutbox` has no env filter and the log has no env: a test-mode and a live event with one idem would collide. D2 (one bucket and one shipper per env) is what keeps them apart.

**Spike result (buzz-school PR #1350, merged; `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-11-06-ledger-event-emission.md`).** The spike departs from the default above, because it found worse. Phase 1 is option (b) for **money and catalog events only**: buzz-school's own webhook and publish code build `payment.succeeded`, `payment.refunded`, `payment.disputed`, `dispute.closed`, `money.skipped` and `catalog.published` with atm's `ledgerEvent` and `catalogPublishedEvent`, in the same SQLite transaction as the lots, into atm's `ledger_outbox` (buzz-school migration `0138`), shipped from the family service, one bucket per environment (`b4uni-<env>-ledger`) with a shipper guard that refuses a row whose `env` is not the service's `billingKeyMode`. It is proven identical to atm's handler for `payment.succeeded` and, bar one field, `payment.refunded`. **Credit events are not in phase 1**: `recordEngineCommand` over buzz-school's lots gives a log that cannot be replayed (`no subject yet: attach a plan first`), and then atm's views job writes nothing, finance views included. Credits need atm's own handler as a shadow, or replacing buzz-school's grant engine: a separate, later decision (D12). Consequences for the UI: balances, `granted`/`rolledOver`/`used`, `Booking.billing` and the audit have no atm source in phase 1 (balances still come from members-list, which reads the live lots); `S8-ui-needs.md` rows that name atm credit events stay `not available`. Production stays off until the E2 and E11 decisions: family-keyed rows must not leave SQLite there today, so S8f is **staging only** until D13 is answered.

## 6. Slices

| Slice | Repo | Delivers | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **S8a** | atm | Month views split: `views/finance/` objects (section 3); income by account and plan; fundraising by campaign; `views/kpi/contributions`; `ledgerRows(events, filter, cursor)`; income statement with `previous` and `previous.changes`; `membersIncome`; a `catalog.published` builder; `runViews(store, school, asOf)` composing read, build and write; export of `shipOutbox`/`planOutbox` from `atm/worker` only if S8d needs it (decision D3). All Worker-safe: no `node:fs`, no Ajv, no hledger. | this file |
| **S8b** | atm | `kpiDocument(...)` as in section 4, and a Worker-safe export of the suppression path (`suppressKpis` reaches Ajv through `scenario/kpis.ts` and `node:crypto` today; Ajv's `new Function` fails in a Worker). Equality test against `gates/oracle.ts` over the 15 presets and the five audiences. | this file; S8a for the contributions view |
| **S8d-bz** | buzz-school | Add to `LEDGER_ROUTES`: `POST .../billing/menu`, `POST .../billing/menu/publish`, `POST .../billing/stripe-key`(`/remove`), `POST /school-admin/key-create`/`key-revoke`. A read for the school's display name (plus time zone, currency, credit unit in one answer). Fix `capabilities` so `publishMenu` is not `built` while its route is unreachable, and add `audit` and `resendReceipt` as `not_built`. Route table test updated. | none |
| **S8d** | buzz-school | Section 5. Spike first. | S8a's builder; the spike's decision |
| **S8c** | atm (or a new package) | The ledger Worker: wrangler config (`nodejs_compat`, R2 binding per env, cron trigger for `runViews`), token verification, school and finance gating, the read endpoints behind the `Reader` calls marked atm in `S8-ui-needs.md`. `dashboardOptions` returns no presets. Tests in Miniflare over seeded R2 built from the 15 presets' events (the `tests/worker-fixture` pattern). | S8a, S8b |
| **S8e** | atm `packages/ledger-ui` | `HttpReader`/`HttpWriter` behind the existing seam. Writes add CSRF and an `Idempotency-Key`, and `publishMenu` asks for the PIN first (the route needs the PIN only, not the mailed-link step-up; `POST /family/pin/verify` is already reachable from the ledger origin). A write shows pending until the manifest `asOf` passes it, and the pending state survives a reload (`S8-ui-needs.md`, "Rules the adapters must keep"). **Gate:** the consistency gates C1–C5 (`gates/run.ts`, `bun run test`) run against this adapter on the Miniflare Worker, as they do against the fixtures. | S8c, S8d-bz |
| **S8f** | both | `ledger-staging.b4uni.com` against a staging bucket, token round trip, one refund and one booking cancel end to end. | all |

S8a, S8b and S8d-bz can run in parallel.

### Status (2026-11-06)

| Slice | PR | State |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S8b | atm #138 | built, mergeable, checked. `kpiDocument(rows, contributions, disclosure, audience, pinLocked, context)`: a sixth `context` argument (`school`, `currency`, `clock`, `preset?`, `plans?`, `donors?`, `days?`, `invented?`). `contributions` is accepted but not read yet: the oracle counts the period's paying members, not per-cell holders (D9, decided 2026-11-06: the paying-member count stays). |
| S8a | atm #139 (stacked on #138) | built, mergeable, checked. Removes `MonthView.money` from `views/months/`, so month objects and every manifest change bytes: the orchestrator regenerates the mart snapshots and goldens in the PR that merges it (`S8a-hash-changes.md`). Finance month objects carry `grossByDay` and `income.planOrder`; contributions use the `KpiContributions` object form. |
| S8d-bz | buzz-school #1348 | built and self-reviewed: `LEDGER_ROUTES` additions, `GET .../ledger/school`, `capabilities` fix, and `docs/features/ledger-ui-gaps.md` (the plan for every other buzz-school gap). |
| S8d | buzz-school | spike done and merged (#1350). Build plan: spike section 9, PRs 0 to 5 (atm release, `ledger_outbox` and shipper with migration `0138`, `catalog.published`, money events, staging, production switch). Not started. |
| S8c, S8e, S8f | | not started. S8c is unblocked (#138 and #139 are in `dev`). S8f is staging only (D13). |

## 7. Corrections to `S8-ui-needs.md` (checked 2026-11-06)

| Row | Was | Now |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `schools()` | school read: gap | Time zone is on `bookings` (`timeZone`); currency, credit unit and tier data on `billing/menu/versions/<n>`. **Only the display name has no ledger-callable route.** |
| `planSummary` per-tier route | confirm | `GET .../billing/members` (counts only) exists but is **not** in `LEDGER_ROUTES`; the ledger origin gets no CORS on it. Add it (S8d-bz) or join members-list in the adapter. |
| `invoiceItems`, `switchTiers` | confirm | The published menu body (`versions/<n>`) holds tiers and add-ons: exists. |
| `schoolRules` | confirm | **Gap.** buzz-school has a per-event `change_cutoff_min` only; no school-level late-cancel or no-show rule. Booking credit hold and spend wait for atm 0.8.0. |
| `settings` reads | confirm | `GET .../billing` (account name, Stripe state) exists, not in `LEDGER_ROUTES`. No `books` setting, no accounting basis, no Zeffy key anywhere. |
| `saveMenu`, `publishMenu` | exists | The routes exist and are **not reachable from the ledger origin** (`LEDGER_ROUTES` needs the literal `versions`). `capabilities` says `publishMenu` is built. Fixed by S8d-bz. |
| `saveStripeKey`, `removeStripeKey` | confirm | Routes exist (`billing/stripe-key`, `/remove`), not in `LEDGER_ROUTES`. |
| `createKey`, `revokeKey` | confirm | Exist at `/school-admin/key-create`, `/key-revoke` (owner, school in the body), not in `LEDGER_ROUTES`. |
| `saveZeffyKey`, `removeZeffyKey`, `saveAccountingBasis`, `saveDisclosure` | confirm | **Not found** in buzz-school. Gaps. |
| `changeRole` | gap | Partly: `POST /school-admin/admins/remove` and admin invites exist; make-admin of an existing member and remove-owner do not. |
| `resumeMembership`, `resendReceipt` | gap | Confirmed not found; `capabilities` does not list them. |
| `donors` | names: gap | Totals by campaign: atm already has `fundraise.received` / `fundraise.paid_out` (accounts `income:fundraising:<campaign>`). Names: no source in atm (events carry none) or buzz-school (no donor or Zeffy storage). |
| `membersSummary`, `people`, `memberDetail` | gap | Unchanged. The member event has `key` and Stripe `customer` only; names come from members-list by `key`. |
| `kpiDocument` | gap | KPI math is pure TypeScript, not DuckDB. The blockers are Ajv and `node:crypto` in the suppression path and the missing contributions view. |

## 8. Decisions, with the default each child assumes

| # | Decision | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1 | How buzz-school emits events | Spike in S8d, default (a), the shadow handler. |
| D2 | Environments | One bucket (or one prefix root) and one shipper per environment. `ledger-staging.b4uni.com` reads staging only. |
| D3 | Where the shipper runs | In the family service next to the existing journal shipper (Bun, `R2Store`). `atm/worker` exports `shipOutbox` only if the Cloudflare move (PR #1273) puts the shipper in a Worker. |
| D4 | Erasure | Open (buzz-school spec E11). `family:<id>` is in an append-only log. atm has a `subject.erased` event type; S8d reads how it works and reports. No claim is made here that it solves erasure. |
| D5 | Donors | Totals by campaign only. Names stay unavailable. |
| D6 | Member portal | Read-only preview in S8; portal writes stay on fixtures. The member routes are deliberately outside `LEDGER_ROUTES`. |
| D7 | Admin without the finance grant | Public audience (spec rule). The orchestrator confirms what the UI expects. |
| D8 | Promos, remindHost, changeRole, switchTier, cancel/resume membership, resendReceipt, audit | Stay on fixtures behind `not_built` capabilities until a route exists. |
| D9 | KPI cell rules: per-cell holders (spec) or the period's paying members (oracle `bkFig`, G1g) | **Decided (owner, 2026-11-06): the period's paying members.** A figure below the live audiences hides when the period has fewer than 5 paying members, as the oracle and the mockup do. `kpiDocument` keeps not reading `contributions` for this rule. |
| D10 | Refund permission | **Decided (owner, 2026-11-06): the owner or any admin.** The finance grant is not needed. buzz-school splits refund from Cedar `MoneyWrite` (invoice and adjust keep their current rule) and `capabilities` answers `refund: allowed` for an admin. The ledger UI follows `capabilities` (ledger-ui PR for D10). |
| D11 | `bookingRules` / `schoolRules` | No source (buzz-school has a per-event cutoff only; credit hold and spend wait for atm 0.8.0). Answer `null`; the UI contract allows it. |
| D12 | Credit events in the log | *Default taken 2026-11-07 under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override.* Not in phase 1 (spike D-1). Decide later between atm's handler as a shadow and replacing buzz-school's grant engine; both need an owner decision and a separate design. Credits screens answer "not available". |
| D13 | May events keyed `family:<id>` reach a production bucket (spike D-3, the E2 question) | *Default taken 2026-11-07 under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override.* No. Staging only; production stays off until the owner and counsel answer. Ties to D4. |
| D14 | Which atm release buzz-school pins for `appendToOutbox`, `catalogPublishedEvent`, `ledgerEvent`, `shipOutbox` (spike D-2) | *Default taken 2026-11-07 under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override.* Cut the release from `dev` and publish it where `packages/atm/release.ts` publishes today (justbry/atm releases), since the rename's release step has not happened; buzz-school pins that tarball by URL and sha512 as before. | **Done 2026-11-07:** `release.ts` publishes to justbry/atm, which lacked the new commits (HTTP 422 `target_commitish` invalid), so justbry/atm `dev` was fast-forwarded to tfd `dev` (`f9c85c9e5..3e3b55a5a`, tfd 31 commits ahead and 0 behind; no force, no history rewritten) and the release rerun. atm 0.10.0 is at https://github.com/justbry/atm/releases/tag/atm-v0.10.0; pin `https://github.com/justbry/atm/releases/download/atm-v0.10.0/atm-0.10.0.tgz`, sha512 `sha512-HHm0dwx5UnUYuNBX2rTHg9WpCJBdoA1RRPYJ4B3DR4Gl+0HfF7SjzABeRrTt8lMfjyXRNVpFFNHgmCwQqKO9pg==`. The orchestrator confirmed the fast-forward is fine. 0.10.0 also ships `atm/worker` in the tarball (0.9.0 did not).
| D15 | Backfill (spike D-5) and payouts (D-6) | *Default taken 2026-11-07 under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override.* No money backfill: the log starts at switch-on and the UI says "from <date>". The catalog backfill is done. A refund or dispute with no `payment.succeeded` in the log is skipped and recorded as `money.skipped` with an audit row. Payout events are out of scope. |
| D16 | Erasure model (spike D-4) | *Default taken 2026-11-07 under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override.* Undecided: the log is never rewritten and a family deletion appends nothing. |
| D17 | How a ledger fault answers Stripe (spike D-7) | *Default taken 2026-11-07 under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override.* As spike section 3.4: a database error is a 500 (Stripe retries); a builder error is logged and audited and the credits still go. |
| D7 | (confirmed 2026-11-07 by the ledger-ui orchestrator) | Matches the UI's `audiencesOf` (`packages/ledger-ui/src/data/disclosure.ts`): an admin without the finance grant gets `public`, or the highest audience of their own live membership tiers if they are an adult, never `finance`; the owner gets `owner`; an admin with the grant gets `finance`. The token carries no tier audience, and the Worker cannot trust a client's claim of one, so until buzz-school adds an `audience` claim to the ledger token (a follow-up to build list group 8) the Worker serves an admin without the grant at most `public`, and the HTTP adapter caps the same way (orchestrator, 2026-11-07); the claim is build list follow-up S8d-bz12. The UI's View as only goes down. |

## 9. Open risks

- Two sources of truth for credit state if the atm handler runs beside buzz-school's lots (section 5). The spike decides; a drift check ships with whichever is chosen.
- The cell rules and the contributions view carry small-school re-identification risk. S8a's contributions object holds counts and a share, never a key.
- The views lag the log by the shipper interval plus the cron interval. The UI already shows a stale chip; the Worker returns `asOf`.
- PR #1273 moves the family service to Cloudflare. If it lands first, D3 and the shipper job change.
- `adjust.ts` says the credit note and kind "belong to the engine's ledger event". Nothing stores that event today, so the comment is true only after S8d.

## 10. Remaining buzz-school gaps: build list

The plan is `docs/features/ledger-ui-gaps.md` in buzz-school (PR #1348): for each gap, what exists, the proposed route and shape matched to the UI contract's field names, the Cedar action, the source, migration and size. It builds nothing. Groups, each one reviewable PR against `main` (M: needs a migration, O: needs an owner decision, S8d: waits on the emission design, C: needs a UI contract change):

| # | Group | Contents | Size | Marks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | S8d-bz2 | `granted`, `rolledOver` on members-list; `ending`, `activeUnits`, `monthlyMinor` on `billing/members` (`monthlyMinor` behind `ViewFinancials`); `ledger/members-summary` | S | C |
| 2 | S8d-bz3 | `seriesLabel` on bookings; `POST .../bookings/<id>/remind` | S | |
| 3 | S8d-bz4 | `ledger/people`; `POST ledger/roles` (`changeRole`) | M | O |
| 4 | S8d-bz5 | `ledger/members/<person>/money` (payments, refundable, `stripeDashboardUrl`); `resendReceipt` | M | O |
| 5 | S8d-bz6 | admin cancel, resume and switch | L | S8d, O |
| 6 | S8d-bz7 | `ledger/settings` read | M | C |
| 7 | S8d-bz8 | member portal preview read | L | S8d, O |
| 8 | S8d-bz9 | disclosure: file, validator, `school_books_disclosure`, tier `audience`, `GET/POST ledger/disclosure` with step-up | L | M, O, C |
| 9 | S8d-bz10 | `audit-facts` read | M | after S8c, S8d |
| 10 | S8d-bz11 | accounting basis, booking rules | M | M, O |
| later | | promos, Zeffy, portal writes for the embed | L each | O |
| follow-up | S8d-bz12 | `audience` claim in the ledger token: the highest audience of the person's own live membership tiers (an adult's `books` level, never `finance` or `owner`), so the Worker can serve an admin without the finance grant above `public` (D7). Needs the tier `audience` field (group 8) first | S | after group 8 |

Groups 8 and 10 need a migration, and so does a gift-code table if promos are built. Which groups are built, and in what order, is decided by the S8 thread with the orchestrator, not by a child.

### UI-found gaps (ledger-ui S8e part 1, 2026-11-07)

Route answers that missed fields the UI's types require, and the choice taken for each (default taken under the owner's S8 goal; the owner may override). Built by the buzz-school thread S8d-bz2 unless noted.

| Gap | Choice |
| --- | --- |
| `views: Record<Audience, AudienceView>` on the Worker's `/disclosure` (grain, delay, rounding, small counts, cell rules, preset and period gates, and the server-worded copy) | New pure `audienceViews({ file, override, size, year, clock })` in `atm/worker` (S8c2). Oracle: for each school record in `packages/ledger-ui/src/fixtures/disclosure.json`, at the fixture clock `2026-11-05T12:00`, it returns exactly that record's `views`; every spec-versus-fixture disagreement is listed, not silently resolved. |
| `GET .../bookings` lacks `attendance` | Join `attendanceFor`. |
| members-list lacks `membershipId` and `MemberBalance.granted` | Add both; `rolledOver` only if the lots give it exactly. `currentPeriodEnd` stays nullable (the UI type is nullable). |
| finance-grants takes a 64-hex pubkey; the UI identifies people by profile id | The route accepts the profile id and answers profile ids (and `grantedBy` if kept); the pubkey form stays one release if cheap. |
| `ledger/school` can answer `null` for time zone, currency, credit unit | Default server-side: zone as today else UTC; currency from the menu, else the connected Stripe account's, else `null`; credit unit from the menu, else `credit`/`credits`; a `defaulted` list names what was defaulted. |
| Saving a menu needs a price on every tier, so a not-for-sale tier returns 400 | A tier with `public: false` may have no prices; `public: true` still needs one. Publish creates no Stripe price for it. |
| Refund `status` can be `requires_action` or `canceled` | The route answers Stripe's status verbatim (documented); the UI adds the two values. |

Contract changes the plan asks for (the orchestrator changes `src/data/` and the fixtures together):
- allow `null` for `expiringGifts`, `bookingRules`, `settings.basis`, `settings.zeffy` and `stripe.missing`;
- `Disclosure.year`, `size` and `views` need income, so the Worker assembles them from buzz-school's file, the school's override and the viewer;
- `PlanTierCount` wants `ending` and `activeUnits`;
- `MembersSummary` lacks `cancelCutoffHours`;
- `Booking.billing` and `auditMember` belong in atm and the Worker (credit holds, replay), fed by a buzz-school facts read.

Not verified by that plan, to check before building: the Stripe dashboard URL format for a live key, and whether setting `receipt_email` on a charge resends a receipt.

## 11. The ledger Worker's read endpoints (S8c)

This is what the UI's `HttpReader` (S8e, `packages/ledger-ui/src/data/`, the orchestrator's) is built against, and what S8c builds. Package `packages/ledger-worker`; entry `src/worker.ts`; staging at `https://ledger-staging.b4uni.com/v1`, production `https://ledger.b4uni.com/v1`. The Worker serves the UI's static assets and `/v1` from one origin, so there is no CORS. Reads only, except the school's config objects (S9.6, `S9-plan.md` section 4, the last three rows of the endpoints table): every other write goes to `api.b4uni.com` (section 2).

**Test harness (a deliverable of S8c).** `packages/ledger-worker/src/testing/harness.ts` exports `startLedgerWorker({ presets, schools })`, which seeds an R2 bucket on Miniflare with the events, `runViews` output and `catalog.published` for the named presets (the 15 mart presets), starts the Worker with a test JWKS, and returns `{ url, mintToken({ sub, schools: [{ id, role, finance }], expiresInSeconds? }), stop() }`. The UI's C1 to C5 gates run S8e against it.

### Conventions for every endpoint

- **Request.** `GET`, `Authorization: Bearer <ledger token>`. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD` in the school's time zone. `:school` is the id in the token's `schools[]`.
- **Success.** `200`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`, body `{ "asOf": string | null, "lagMinutes": number | null, "data": <shape> }`. `asOf` is the views manifest's `asOf` (ISO instant); `lagMinutes` is now minus `asOf`, rounded up; both are `null` only on the `no_data` error. `data` is the `Reader` method's return type, except where a row says otherwise.
- **Missing figures.** A field with no source is `null` in `data` (D11); a whole answer with no source is `501 not_available` (D12). **No endpoint answers 0, an empty list or `none` for something it cannot know.** The adapter turns `null` and `not_available` into the UI's "not available" state; the contract types allow the `null`s listed below.
- **Errors.** `{ "error": { "code": string, "message": string, "field"?: string, "retryAfterSeconds"?: number } }`, `Cache-Control: private, no-store`:

| Status | `code` | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 401 | `token_missing`, `token_invalid`, `token_expired` | No bearer, a token that fails any check in section 2, or an expired one. `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer error="invalid_token"`. The UI mints a new token and retries once. |
| 403 | `finance_required` | A finance-only endpoint and the school's entry has `finance:false`. |
| 403 | `audience_not_allowed` | `audience` finer than the caller may view (section 4). |
| 404 | `not_found` | A school that is unknown or not in the token's `schools[]`: the same body for both. |
| 404 | `no_data` | The school is in the token but has no views manifest yet. `asOf` and `lagMinutes` are `null`; the UI says "no ledger data yet". |
| 400 | `bad_request` | A missing or malformed query field (`field` names it). |
| 409 | `view_mismatch` | A view object differs from the manifest (a run is in flight). `retryAfterSeconds` is 5. |
| 429 | `rate_limited` | `retryAfterSeconds` is set. |
| 501 | `not_available` | D12 and the rows below. `message` says why in one sentence. |
| 503 | `views_unavailable` | The log cannot be replayed (`SummaryProblem.kind`) or R2 failed. |
| 403 | `owner_only`, `step_up_required` | A config verify or put by someone who is not the school's owner; a config put whose token has no `su` claim within the last 10 minutes (D22; until buzz-school sends `su`, every put). |
| 412 | `stale_etag` | A config put whose `If-Match` is not the object's current sha256, or `If-None-Match: *` for an object that exists. |
| 422 | `invalid_config` | A config put whose value fails its validator (`error.problems[]`: `{path, message, hint}`), or whose `verifiedHash` is not the hash of the canonical value (problem path `verifiedHash`). |

### Endpoints

| Path and query | Gate | `data` | `Reader` method it backs | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/schools` | any token | `{ schools: [{ id, asOf: string \| null, lagMinutes: number \| null, stale: boolean }] }` for the token's schools | `School.stale`, `School.lagMinutes` (the adapter merges them into `schools()`) | `stale` is `lagMinutes > 15`. A school with no manifest has `null`s and `stale: true`. Name, time zone, currency and credit unit are not here (`GET .../ledger/school` on the family service). |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/kpi?audience=&pin=open\|locked` | audience gate | `KpiDocument` | `kpiDocument`; `audienceReport` for public, member and governance | `source` is `{kind:"events"}` and `dataSource` `"events"`. `pin=locked` is always allowed; `pin=open` is honoured as is (the token was minted with the PIN open). A school with no usable `catalog.published` has plans in alphabetical order. No `preset` parameter. |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/disclosure` | any token | `{ school, year, size, file, override: null, source: "defaults", views, viewAs }` where `views: Record<Audience, AudienceView>` is `audienceViews({ file, override, size, year, clock })` and `viewAs: Record<ViewAs, { name, summary, locks }>` is `viewAsRows({ file, override, views, adminAudience })`, both from `atm/worker` (S8c2, S8e part 3). `adminAudience` is the books audience the Admin row shows this caller: `member` for an owner or a finance admin (a preview), the caller's own (`public`, D7) for an admin without the grant | `disclosure` (the adapter adds `viewer` with `audiencesOf` from the token's claim, and each row's `held`, `audience` and `admin`; `viewer.name` is `null`, since no route gives the signed-in person's name) | `file` is the B4 Uni file shipped with the Worker. `override` is `null` until buzz-school stores one (build list group 8): the UI says "B4 Uni defaults". |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/audience-report?audience=public\|member\|governance&from=&to=` | audience gate | `AudienceReport` | `audienceReport` | Derived from the same KPI document; same errors. |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/ledger?from=&to=&type=&drill=` | finance | `LedgerPage` with each entry's `member` as `{ key } \| null` (the adapter fills `id` and `name` from members-list) | `ledger` | `pending` is always `[]` (the Worker cannot see buzz-school's unshipped outbox; the UI keeps its own pending writes). `timeZone`, `currency` and `unit` come from the latest `catalog.published` menu, else `null`. `promo` is not a parameter: a request with `promo` is `501 not_available`. `drill=disc` returns no rows (no event records a discount). A page holds at most one `from` to `to` range of 62 days (`400 bad_request` beyond). |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/income-statement?from=&to=&compare=0\|1` | finance | `IncomeStatement` | `incomeStatement` | `amounts.discounts`, `amounts.giftsSold`, `giftsOutstanding` and `matchesStripe` are `null`; `basis` is `{kind:"cash"}`; `amounts.income` is income less fundraising; `net` is what `hledger is` prints (it includes disputes and the B4 Uni share). `previous` and `previous.changes` when `compare=1`. |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/members-income?from=&to=` | finance | `{ cents: number }` | `membersIncome` | |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/members/:key/money` | finance | `{ payments: PaymentRow[], history: HistoryEvent[] }` | the money half of `memberDetail` | `:key` is `family:<id>` URL-encoded. Shapes as in `members.ts`; a field with no source is `null`. `refundable` and `stripeDashboardUrl` come from the family service, not here. Money events only in phase 1, so `history` has no credit events. Unknown key: `404 not_found`. |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/fundraising?from=&to=` | finance | `{ campaigns: [{ campaign, receivedCents, count }], paidOutCents: number }` | none yet (optional UI hook) | From `fundraise.received` and `fundraise.paid_out`; payouts name no campaign. |
| `GET /v1/schools/:school/config/:name` | any listed school; `finance` for `promos` | The object as stored (`settings`, `disclosure`, `booking-rules`, `plans-draft`, `promos`, or `manifest`), header `ETag: "<sha256 of the bytes>"` | `settings`, `schoolRules`, `promos`, `planSummary` (the config part) | Not read from the views, so `asOf` and `lagMinutes` are the views' when the school has them and `null` when it has none. Unwritten: `404 not_found`. |
| `POST /v1/schools/:school/config/:name/verify` | owner; `finance` for `promos` | `{ ok, problems: [{path, message, hint}], diff: [{path, change, before?, after?}], verifiedHash, baseEtag }`; body `{ value }` | none | Writes nothing. `ok:false` is a `200` with `verifiedHash: null` and `diff: []`. `baseEtag` is the stored sha256, or `null` for an unwritten object. |
| `PUT /v1/schools/:school/config/:name` | owner with a fresh `su` (<= 10 minutes); `finance` for `promos` | `{ name, sha256, bytes, changed }`, header `ETag` | none | Body `{ value, verifiedHash }`, header `If-Match: "<baseEtag>"` (`If-None-Match: *` for an object not written yet). Re-validates, checks `verifiedHash`, conditional put, one audit line `config/audit/YYYY-MM.jsonl` (`at`, opaque `by`, `name`, `before`, `after`), then `config/manifest.json`. A value equal to the stored one answers `changed: false` and writes nothing. |
| `GET /healthz` | none | `{ ok: true }` (no `asOf`) | | |

**`501 not_available`, today:** `donors` (names have no source anywhere and a spread needs donor identity, so the Worker has no `donors` endpoint and the adapter answers the UI's not-available state without a request), `promos`, `schoolRules`, `memberPortal`, `auditMember`, every credit figure (D12: `used`, `granted`, `rolledOver`, `Booking.billing`), `Person` rows and the members summary (family service). The Worker serves none of these and has no route for them.

**Contract type changes this table asks of the orchestrator** (`src/data/`, the orchestrator's): `IncomeStatement.amounts.discounts` and `giftsSold`, `giftsOutstanding` and `matchesStripe` allow `null`; `LedgerPage.timeZone`, `currency` and `unit` allow `null`; `IncomeStatement.currency` and `unit` allow `null` (Reports falls back to the school's `currency` and `creditUnit`, as the Ledger does) and `Viewer.name` allows `null` (S8e part 3); the `LedgerEntry.member` join and `Disclosure` assembly happen in the adapter.
